Don't like **burritos**? **Try a quesedilla** instead! While burritos are not everyone's first choice, **quesedillas are delicious** and are popular among everyone. **Quesedillas are similar to burritos** but often don't have as many toppings as a burrito, prepared with two tortillas instead of one, and have more cheese. Quesedillas are perfect snacking foods but can also be turned into a heartier meal if prepared with a protein option such as chicken, pork, steak, or tofu. For anyone who isn't a fan of burritos, a **quesedilla can be customized** to your liking and is always a winner.
